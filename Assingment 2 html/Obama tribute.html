      <h2>Why I Admire Barack Obama</h2>
      <p>
        Barack Obama has always been more than just a politician to me — he is a symbol of hope, intelligence, and calm strength. The first time I watched one of his speeches, I remember feeling deeply inspired, like I, too, could rise above limitations and make a difference in the world.
      </p>

      <h2>His Story</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961, Obama’s journey to the White House was anything but ordinary. Raised by a single mother and grandparents, he faced many challenges growing up — but he never let those challenges define him. Through hard work and education, he rose to become a community organizer, a senator, and eventually, the 44th President of the United States.
      </p>

      <h2>His Impact</h2>
      <p>
        As President, he inspired millions with his message of “Yes We Can.” He passed the Affordable Care Act, restored diplomatic ties with Cuba, and advocated for clean energy and climate action. But more than his policies, what stood out to me was the way he carried himself — with grace, dignity, and empathy.
      </p>

      <h2>What I’ve Learned from Him</h2>
      <p>
        Obama taught me that true leadership isn’t about power — it’s about service. He showed that even in the face of criticism or adversity, it’s possible to lead with kindness and integrity. He gave people — especially young people like me — the courage to dream big.
      </p>
